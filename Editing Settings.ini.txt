Threshold is the extra number of clipboard that will be active 
other than your minimum limit..
Dont set it to be 0,zero can cause memory slow - down.
Most recommended value is 10.

"Transfered to ClipJump" message or not while copy/cut 
operations.
1 = enabled (default)
0 = disabled

 ==== Quality_of_Thumbnail_Previews ===

restart or simply Windows restart if you run it at Start up.
