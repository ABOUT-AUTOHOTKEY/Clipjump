<h4>Basic Usage</h4>
<ul>
<li>After Downloading ClipJump,unzip and run ClipJump.exe .<br>
It's a portable application so no installation needed. Keep it in a directory of your choice and move on.<br>
<li>An icon of ClipJump in SystemTray will come .<br>
<li>Try copying either by Ctrl+C or by Copy or PrintScreen,
<li>You will notice a Tip, <b>[Transfered to ClipJump]</b>  when you copy something.This will mean that the copy has been succeeded.<br><br>
<li>Now, press Ctrl+V, you will see a tip containing the file or text to be copied.<strong class="super">[This is Paste Mode]</strong>.
If an Image has been copied, a Window showing your image will pop-up.<br>
Release Control to perform actions. <i>(You will know later)</i><br>
Here, Release it (Control) to paste.<br> <br>
<li>To move through Multiple ClipBoards,press V again while holding Control.<br>
Release Control to Paste.Use C while holding Control to move backwards.
<li>To Cancel Copy,press X while in Paste mode <b>[Control Pressed]</b>.<br>

The tip should change to a Delete All message.This is <b>[Delete All Mode]</b> <br>
Then release Control to confirm.
</ul>
<h3>Notes</H3><ul>
<li>As you can see, Releasing Control is the basis of performing actions in ClipJump.
<li>Also, note that Cancel Mode,Delete Mode and Delete All Mode are inter-related.
<strong class="mild">The program cycles through these modes when you press X while holding Control.</strong><br>
<b>So, pressing X while holding Control in [Delete All Mode] will switch back to Cancel Mode.</b>
</ul><br>

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
<a name="fixate">
<h3>The Fixate Option</h3>
The Fixate option is meant to hold a current Clipboard at a fixed position while the
positions of all other Clipboards change.<br>Thus, if a Clipboard is fixed at [Clip 1], it
will stay there at Clip 1 even after numerous Copies and Cuts.<br>
This can be useful if you want a Clipboard entry to be easily accessible every time you
go in Paste Mode using Ctrl+V. <b>Fixing a Clip at Position 1 will mean the clip will stay there
everytime in the world you press Control and then a Single press of V.</b><br><br>
<strong class="super">Using Fixate</strong><br><br>
Pressing SPACE while in [Paste Mode] toggles the Fixed status of a Clip.<br>
If you reach the clip of your choice and want to fix it, press SPACE and you
will notice a "[FIXED]" written after <b>(Clip x of y)</b>.<br>
This means the Clip is Fixed there. As said above , <strong class="mild">pressing SPACE again
one the fixed Clip will remove the FIX from it and the [FIXED] text will
dissappear.</strong><br><br>
<strong class="super">The DeleteAll option will delete FIXED Clips.</strong><br><hr>
<h3>Copying Paths to Clipjump</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+C will copy path(s) of selected files in Windows
Explorer.<br>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+X will copy path of current opened folder in Windows
Explorer.</ul><br>
</a><hr>
<A name="winclip">
<h3>Selective Windows Clipboard</h3>
Many a times there are situations where <b>you are not allowed to paste using the old
shortcut Control+V</b> (such as in Command Prompt).<br>
There the Selective Windows Clipboard Option comes handy.<br><br>
<strong class="super">Using</strong><br><br>
Cycle through the clipboards by Control+V or C .When you reach the clip of your choice,
<b>press S</b> while holding Control.<br>
You will see a Confirmation <b>(Windows Clipboard has Clip x)</b> in form of tip.
That's it.<br>
Now, the Right-Click > Paste Or any other option to Paste <i>other than the old Control + V</i>
will paste the Clip you had choose as it is  currently stored in Windows Clipboard.</a><br><br><hr>
