<b>Clipjump</b> is a Multiple-Clipboard management utility for Windows.
It was built to make working with multiple clipboards super fast and super easy.
The program records changes in the system clipboard, stores them without any limits and provides innovative ways to work with them.
<br><br>
<b>The program was created to overcome some of the limits other clipboard managers had</b>.
<ol>
<li>Use of Shortcuts other than Ctrl+X,C,V
<li>No preview of Printscreen captures stored on Clipboard.
<li>Limited number of Clipboards.
<li>Take long to switch between multiple - clipboards.
<li>Shareware
</ol>
<br>
<h4>Here are few reasons to like Clipjump</h4> 
<ul>
<li>It Captures every change on Clipboard regardless of data-types.
<li>Supports preview of Clipboard stored images such as Printscreen captures.
<li>Control Multiple-Clipboards only by using the single shortcut Ctrl+V (which is also configurable)
<li>Can have as much as simultaneous clipboards as possible, no LIMIT.</li>
<li>Very (very) fast Clipboard switching.
<li>Fast and powerful searching to help find needed content while pasting.
<li>Batch/Multiple Pasting
<li>Highly Configurable, thanks to <a href="docs/custom.html">ClipjumpCustom</a>
<li>Not touches the registry and System drive.
<li><a href="docs/translate.html">Multilingual</a>, free, portable, Unicode, <a href="https://github.com/aviaryan/Clipjump">open source</a>
</ul><br>
