<dl>
	<dt>I had the copied the file/folder to Clipjump but when I paste it , nothing happens ?
	<dd><li>Make sure that what you are pasting is a [FILE/FOLDER] and not it's path.
		<li>Make sure that you are pasting it in a file manager such as Windows Explorer.
		<li>Check that the path given by Clipjump's [PASTE MODE] tip exists . This means if Clipjump's tip contains <code>C:\test.txt</code> , then make 
			sure the file exists. 

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>The Clear History button in History Tool doesn't delete the recent Clips in Ctrl+V Paste Mode ?
	<dd>The History Tool and the Paste-Mode are two different components and there clips are independent of each other . <br>
		The <code>Clear History</code> button deletes all the History items whereas the <a href="basic_help.html#delete_all">DeleteAll mode</a> deletes all the clips that are in that channel.

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>I copy an image from Windows Explorer but I don't see it's preview in the Paste Mode ?
	<dd>The thing you copy when you press Ctrl+C on an image file in Windows Explorer is the link to the file and not the file's data . <br>
		Similarly here, you are not copying the image but the link to the image file. To copy the image to Clipjump , you have 2 ways -
		<li>Open the image in an Image editor such as MS Paint. Select a region and then from the Right click menu, select <code>Copy</code>.
		<li>Use the <a href="basic_help.html#fdata">Copy File Data</a> feature and press its shortcut while selecting the image file in Explorer 
			or any other file manager. You will notice the <code>Transferred to Clipjump</code> and then the (previewed) image will be available on Clipjump.

	<dt>I have disabled the <i>Retain Clipboard data after Restart</i> feature but the clips in Paste Mode are still there ?
	<dd><a href="channels.html#channel_notes">See Here</a>

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>Will my clips lose formatting when I enable the NO-FORMATTING option ?</dt>
	<dt>Is no formatting permanent ?</dt>
	<dd><a href="basic_help.html#nof_notes">See Here</a>

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>Why do I get the warning <i>Clipjump is not running as administrator</i> ?
	<dd>When Clipjump, a portable application is placed in drives or folders which don't allow users to write to them , Clipjump will not be able to 
		save its clips and thus will become of no use. To avoid such a condition, a one time warning is coded into Clipjump to aware users of the 
		fact.

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>Will updating Clipjump preserve my settings , history and clips ?
	<dd>Yes , you will lose nothing. 

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>How do I update Clipjump ?
	<dd>To update Clipjump , follow these steps - 
		<li>Close Clipjump from the tray menu.
		<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.avi-win-tips.blogspot.com/p/clipjump.html">site</a> and download the latest version. 
		<li>Extract the latest version from the archive and copy its files.
		<li>Paste the files on your current copy of Clipjump such that <i>new</i> Clipjump.exe replaces the old one.
		<li>Run Clipjump.exe

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>I don't want duplicate data to be stored in Clipjump . What should I do ?
	<dd>These are some steps you can undertake to avoid redundancy in Clipjump -
		<li>Change the setting <code>is_duplicate_copied</code> to 0 in the [Advanced] section of the Settings.ini to make sure Clipjump doesn't copy duplicate data 
			when they are sent one after another.
		<li>Whenever doing some work in which you are ought to copy duplicate/crap data to Clipboard (Clipjump) , consider using the <a href="channels.html#pit">Pit channel
			</a>.</li>

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>Can History Tool only store distinct history items ?
	<dd>No. The History tool in Clipjump is meant to keep track of all the clips that were copied to Clipjump with their timestamps.<br>
		If you are looking to free History disk consumption, try sorting the Window with the 'Size' column. 

	<br><br><br>

	<dt>The Column Mode data in Notepad++ is not pasted properly ?
	<dd>This is a known issue. A way out will be <b>1)</b> copying the column mode text as usual and then <br>2)</b> using Right Click > Paste to paste what's on the Clipboard. The Right Click Paste necessarily signifies that you have to paste data from clipboard without invoking Clipjump. 
	Alternatively, you can also use the <code>Disable Clipjump</code> option to take Clipjump out of the equation and make the copy-paste process 
	normal.

	 <br><br><br>

	 <dt>I get the 'Pit Channel not found' message when I try to use the 'PitSwap' feature ?
	 <dd>PitSwap as you may know switches to a channel named 'Pit' when it is used. As you probably have not created a channel named 'Pit' , you are getting this error. 
	 Go to the channel selector GUI to create a channel named as 'Pit' and you will be OK. 

	 <br><br><br>

	<dt>How do I see a larger preview of image in the History Preview ?
	<dd>History Preview window automatically resizes the image contained with its dimensions . You can drag the Preview window from its edges to resize the window with the 
		respective image. To view the maximum possible size of an image , simply maximize the Preview window. The same applies for Text Previews too.
