	<h2><a name=about>About</a></h2>
	Clipjump Channels are meant to allow users to use multiple channels of multiple Clipboards for sorting related Clipboard items together.<br />
	The feature is accessible from the Clipjump Action Mode (with easy key S) as well as the Tray Menu. <br /><br />
	Channels are different series or groups in which clips are stored. <br> 
	You can create unlimited <strong class=super>distinctly named</strong> channels to store Clipboard data and store related clips in them. 
	<br />The default channel is 0 and is named as <i>Default</i>.<br />
	<br /><br />

	<h2><a name=using>How to Use</a></h2>
	As said above, use the default shortcut or the Tray Menu for Clipjump to open the choose Channel Window.<br />
	The Window should appear instantly and you will see the Channel Number 0 (Default) to be active by default.<br />
	Use the Up Down <b>arrow keys</b> and select a different channel. As 0 is the only channel used in a new installation of Clipjump, you will be only allowed to select the next Channel 1 . 
	Select the new channel and <b>give it a name</b>. Now click <b><u>U</u>se Channel</b>. You will see a tip containing a confirmation message that Channel [name] is now active where <code>name</code> is the name of your channel.<br />

	Now try copying some data to Clipboard an you will see the confirmation tip <i>"Transferred to Clipjump"</i> to be preceeded by a <i>{[name]}</i> which will mean the item is now captured to Clipjump Channel 1. <br />
	
	Now press Ctrl+V to enter <strong class=super>[PASTE MODE]</strong> . You will see a <i>{[name]}</i> also preceeding the Clip number message <i>(Clip x of y)</i> . As
	 you have already guessed , this means the Clip is contained in Channel [name] .<br>
	<a href="../images/channelpaste.jpg"><img src="../images/channelpaste.jpg" border="0"></a>
	<br /><br>
	Now as you are using Channel 1, you can open the Channel window and use the next available Channel (Channel 2) . <strong class=mild> You can use as many as channels you want </strong> and give them any name you like.<br />
	<br />
	
	<strong class="super"><a name="channel_notes">IMPORTANT</a></Strong><br>
	Note that Clipjump uses Channel 0 as the default and the main channel and should be used for general purposes . Channel 0 (Default) is the only channel for which the <i><b>
	Minimum Number of Active Clips</b></i> setting is valid, all other channel have no minimum and thus store unlimited clips. <br>
	The setting <i>Retain Clipboard data upon Application restart</i> is invalid on channels other than 0 and so channels 1+ store clips until they are deleted by the user.
	<br /><br /><br />

	<h2><a name=chnljumps>Changing Channels in Paste Mode</a></h2>
	<i>[v9.5+]</i> You can change channels in the <b>Paste Mode</b> itself by using the Up-down keys . Use the <code>Up</code> arrow key to increment the channel by 1 and 
	use the <code>Down</code> arrow key to decrement the channel by 1. Cycling channels via this method works like a cycle , so if you press the Up arrow key with the last 
	Channel (say #2) active , you will be jumped back to the first channel (#0).

	<br><br><br>

	<h2><a name=uses>Ideas on using</a></h2>
	One of the best uses of Clipjump Channels is using it as a top 10 repository for storing frequently used items. As said above , you can copy and thus save your signatures , blog links and avatar images in a channel and quickle access them when needed.
	<br><br /><br />

	<h2><a name=pit>The "Pit" Channel</a></h2>
	The <code>Pit</code> channel is a reserved channel NAME with automatic Incognito feature. When a channel is named as <code>Pit</code>, the channel does not transfer 
	it's clips to the Clipjump History thus creating a false <i>INCOGNITO MODE</i> situation. Note that when a channel named <code>Pit</code> is active, the INCOGNITO mode 
	is physically not turned ON and so you don't see the Clipjump's tray icon being grayed out.<br>
	The "Pit" channel can be <b>quickly</b> used to capture <i>junk</i> or <i>confidential</i> data to Clipjump and then delete them all at once with the Delete ALL mode 
	(Ctrl + V + X + X + X)
	<br><br><br>
	
	<h2><a name=pitswap>PitSwap</a></h2>
	<code>PitSwap</code> <i>[v9.5+]</i> allows you to jump to an existing Pit channel from any other active channel with the ease of a hotkey. Activated with the Action Mode easy key P , it is a sort of 'channel toggler'. When pressing PitSwap shortcut when a channel such as Default(#0) is active , the channel will be
	automatically changed to a found <code>Pit</code> named channel. When pressing the shortcut , the toggle will work in reverse changing the active channel back to the one
	you were using (here 'Default') . Note that the PitSwap toggle is deactivated <b>silently</b> when you first use PitSwap and then eventually change the Pit channel 
	with the <b>Channel Selector GUI</b> OR by the Up-down keys in the Paste Mode.

	<br><br><br>
	
	<h2><a name=tips>Tips for better productivity</a></h2>
	<ul>
	<li>You can use the up-down arrow keys rather than Mouse clicks for increasing/decreasing Channel numbers.
	<li>When in the default channel selecter mode, use Alt+U as a shortcut for the <code>Use Channel</code> button.
	<li>I recommend using the Minimal GUI for the channel Selector. This feature can be accessed from the <code>Channels</code> section 
	of the Settings Tool. When using the minimal GUI , you will have to use Up-Down arrow keys to change channels and <strong class=mild> Enter key to activate a channel
	</strong>.
	<li>If you regulary change Clipjump channels, you can also create a system-level shortcut for opening Channels manager directly rather than using a 2nd level Action 
	Mode shortcut from the Settings Editor.
