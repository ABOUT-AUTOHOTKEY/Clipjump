<h4><a name=bu>Basic Usage</a></h4><br>
<ul>
<li>After Downloading Clipjump, unzip it and run Clipjump.exe .<br>
It's a portable application so no installation is needed.<br>
<li>When you run the exe, Clipjump's icon will be seen in SystemTray.<br><br>
<a href="../images/trayicon.jpg"><img src="../images/trayicon.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>Try copying either by Ctrl+C or by Right Click -> Copy or Shift+PrintScreen
<li>You will notice a Tip, <b>[Transferred to Clipjump]</b>  when you copy something.This will mean that the copy has been succeeded.<br><br>
<a href="../images/copy.jpg"><img src="../images/copy.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>Now, press <b>Ctrl+V</b>(paste action), you will see a tip containing the file or text to be copied.<strong class="super">[This is Paste Mode]</strong>.
If an Image has been copied, a Window showing your image will pop-up.<br>
You will have to release Ctrl to perform actions. <i>(You will know later)</i><br>
Here, Release Ctrl to paste.<br> <br>

<a href="../images/pasting.png"><img src="../images/pasting.png" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>To move through Multiple Clipboards, press V again while holding Ctrl. [while in Paste Mode]<br>
Release Ctrl to Paste.Tap C while holding Ctrl to move backwards.
<li>To Cancel Copy, press X while in Paste mode <b>[Ctrl Pressed]</b>.<br>
The tip should change to a Cancel Message. This is <strong class="mild">[Cancel Mode]</strong><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.<br>

<a href="../images/cancel.jpg"><img src="../images/cancel.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>To Delete Current Clipboard, press X twice in Paste Mode or once in Cancel Mode.
The tip should now change to a Delete Message. This is <b>[Delete Mode]</b><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.<br><br>
<a href="../images/delete.jpg"><img src="../images/delete.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>

<a name=delete_all></a>
To Delete all Clips, press X thrice in Paste Mode OR twice in Cancel Mode OR once in Delete Mode.
The tip should change to a Delete All message.This is <b>[Delete All Mode]</b> <br>
<a href="../images/deleteall.jpg"><img src="../images/deleteall.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
Release Ctrl and then confirm the confirmation tip with <i>Y</i> to proceed. 


</ul><br>
<h3>Notes</H3>
<ul>
	<li>As you can see, Releasing Ctrl is the basis of performing actions in Clipjump.
	<li>Also, note that Cancel Mode,Delete Mode and Delete All Mode are inter-related.
	<strong class="mild">The program cycles through these modes when you press X while holding Ctrl.</strong><br>
	<b>So, pressing X while holding Ctrl in Delete All Mode will switch back to Cancel Mode.</b>
</ul><br>
<hr><br>

<h2><a name=au>Advanced Usage</a></h2>

<h3><a name=actmd>Action Mode</a></h3>
Action Mode provides a clean user-friendly interface to execute almost all the other components of Clipjump. Activated with the default configurable shortcut 
Ctrl+Shift+A , it provides easy keys to run components of Clipjump. <br>
Action Mode easy keys <a href=ini.html#actmd_keys>can be changed</a> via the Advanced section of the Settings ini file.
<br><br><br>

<a name="fixate"></a>
<h3><a name=fx>The Fixate Option</a></h3>
The Fixate option is meant to hold a current Clipboard at a fixed position while
positions of all other Clipboards change.<br>Thus, if a Clipboard is fixed at [Clip 1], it
will stay there at Clip 1 even after numerous Copies and Cuts.<br>
This can be useful if you want a Clipboard entry to be easily accessible every time you
go in Paste Mode using Ctrl+V. <br>

<strong class="super">Please note</strong> that Clipjump remembers last pasted clip's position. So, if you have just pasted [Clip 5], Clipjump will
<b>start from [Clip 5]</b> the next time you press Ctrl and then V [Paste Mode].<br>
A workaround to go to [Clip 1] quickly can be going into [Cancel Mode] after pressing Ctrl+V and canceling and then again pressing Ctrl+V.
Clipjump will now start from [Clip 1]<br><br>

<strong class="super">Using Fixate</strong><br>
Pressing SPACE while in [Paste Mode] toggles the Fixed status of a Clip.<br>
If you reach the clip of your choice and want to fix it, press SPACE and you
will notice a "[FIXED]" written after <b>(Clip x of y)</b>.<br>
This means the Clip is Fixed there. As said above , <strong class="mild">pressing SPACE again
on the fixed clip will remove the FIX from it and the "[FIXED]" from the tip will disappear.</strong>
<br><br>
<a href="../images/fixate.jpg"><img src="../images/fixate.png" border="0"></a><br><br>
<strong class="super">Note that the DeleteAll option will delete FIXED Clips too.</strong><br><hr><br>

<h3><a name=path>Copying Paths to Clipjump</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+C will copy path(s) of selected files in all file managers including Windows Explorer.<br>
<a href="../images/path.jpg"><img src="../images/path.jpg" border="0"></a>
<li>Using Action Mode and then X will copy path of current opened folder in all file managers including Windows Explorer. You can also create an independent shortcut 
for this function in the Settings Editor. 
</ul>
</a><hr><br><br>

<h3><a name=fdata>Copying File content to Clipjump</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F will copy selected file's content to Clipjump.
<li>This function works with all file managers including Windows Explorer.
<li>This module will also work on Image files and <a href=#export>exported Clipboard files (.cj)</a>.
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3><a name=paste>Changing Paste-Mode shortcut</a></h3>
To force Clipjump Paste Mode to be activated by some other key other than Ctrl+V, you can use the Settings editor of Clipjump. <br>
Simply open the editor and look for the <code>Paste Mode(Ctrl +..)</code> value in the <code>Shortcuts</code> group. Change the default <i>V</i> in the box to some other key to make the Clipjump Paste Mode to be activated by the Ctrl combination of that key. Make the value blank  to disable <code>Clipjump Paste Mode</code>.
<br><br><br>

<h3><a name=ot>One Time Stop</a></h3>
Many a times you have applications that use Clipboard's common transfer to extract data from various locations.
These apps can be a headache when used with as consistent a tool as Clipjump. <br>
The <b>One Time Stop</b> feature just solves this problem. Available with a configurable independent shortcut which is by default unassigned, 
you can call it once to make Clipjump automatically ignore the last data and linked content that is transferred to System Clipboard and so Clipjump. 
In this period, what really happens is that the Clipjump Clipboard Monitoring is 
deactivated , a feature which can be controlled via <a href="../clipjumpcontroller.html">Clipjump Controller</a>. <br> 
<strong class=super>NOTE</strong> - When Clipboard Monitoring is disabled (as in One Time Stop) , Clipjump's tray icon will become dark.  
<br><br>
<strong class=super>WARNING</strong> - <b>One Time Stop</b> is deactivated when Paste Mode is accessed in the <i>ignore</i> period.
<br><br><br>

<a name="winclip">
<h3>Selective Windows Clipboard</h3></a><br>
Many a times there are situations where <b>you are not allowed to paste using the old shortcut Ctrl+V</b> (like in Command Prompt).<br>
There the Selective Windows Clipboard Option comes handy.<br><br>
<strong class="super">Using</strong><br>
Cycle through the clipboards by Ctrl+V or C .When you reach the clip of your choice,
<b>press S</b> while holding Ctrl.<br>
You will see a Confirmation <b>(System Clipboard has Clip x)</b> in form of tip.
That's it.<br>
Now, the Right-Click > Paste Or any other option to Paste <i>other than the old Ctrl + V</i>
will paste the Clip you had choose like it is  currently stored in System Clipboard.<br><hr><br>

<!-- NOF -->

<a name=nof><h3>No-Formatting Mode</h3>
No formatting mode truncates formatting from Clipjump clips when they are pasted.<br>
To access this mode, use the "Z" key as the toggle when in <strong class=super>[PASTE MODE]</strong><br>
Press "Z" once while in [PASTE MODE] and you will see a <strong class="super">[NO-FORMATTING]</strong> in the Tip.<br>
This will mean all the clipboard data pasted from now onwards will have Formatting truncated.<br>
To disable this mode, press "Z" again while in [PASTE MODE] and the [NO-FORMATTING] text will dissappear.<br><br>

<strong class=super><a name="nof_notes">Note that</a></strong> that the No-Formatting setting doesn't mean that clips copied will not have any formatting, this means that the formatting will be removed from them <b>temporarily</b> when they are pasted.<br><br>
<img src="../images/noformat.png" border="0">

<br><br>
<strong class=super>TIP</strong> - To make Clipjump start by default in NO-FORMATTING mode , see the option <code>Start with No Formatting Enabled</code> in the Settings editor. 
<br><br><br>

<!-- EXP -->

<a name=export><h3>Export and share Clipboards</a></h3>
Clipjump supports exporting clipboards as files which can be stored as a record OR send to a friend.<br>
The feature is accessible by tapping <code>E</code> in <strong class=super>[PASTE MODE]</strong> and by the shortcut <code>Ctrl+E</code> in the Clipjump History Tool.<br>
The Clip or Clipboard when exported will be saved in "My Documents" with a name <code>export[x].cj</code> where <code>x</code> is a variable.<br>
The <code>.cj</code> file extension when used with <a href=#fdata>Copy File Data</a> directs Clipjump to load the file contents into itself.
<br><br /><br>


<h3><a name=reset>Resetting Clipjump</a></h3>
<i>[v9.5+]</i> To reset Clipjump to its default settings and remove <b>all the data</b> created by Clipjump on your computer , use this option . The option can be found in 
the About window for Clipjump. The data that will be removed includes history items, paste mode clips, extracted icons and the settings file.

<br><br><br>

<a name=disable><h3>Disable Clipjump</h3></a>
<i>[v9.7+]</i> You can disable Clipjump  ( i.e. Clipboard Monitoring and Paste Mode ) from the Tray Menu as well as Action Mode. In Action Mode, this option is available 
with the easy key <code>D</code><br>.
To have more control over Clipjump, see <a href="../clipjumpcontroller.html">Clipjump Controller</a> .
