<h1>Clipjump</h1>
v 11.0
<br><br>

<b>Clipjump</b> is a Multiple-Clipboard management utility for Windows.
It was built to make working with multiple clipboards super fast and super easy.
The program records changes in the system clipboard, stores them without any limits and provides innovative ways to work with them.

<br>

<br><br>
Here are few reasons to like Clipjump. 
<ul>

<li>Supports preview of Clipboard stored images such as Printscreen captures.
<li>Control Multiple-Clipboards only by using the single shortcut Ctrl+V (which is also configurable)
<li>Can have as much as simultaneous clipboards as possible, no LIMIT.</li>
<li>Very (very) fast Clipboard switching.
<li>Fast and powerful searching to help find needed content while pasting.
<li>Batch/Multiple Pasting
<li>Highly Configurable, thanks to <a href="docs/custom.html">ClipjumpCustom</a>
<li>Not touches the registry and System drive.
<li><a href="translations/">Multilingual</a>, free, portable, Unicode, <a href="https://github.com/aviaryan/Clipjump">open source</a>
</ul><br>
<br>
