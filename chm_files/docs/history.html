<h2>Introduction</h2>
Clipjump's Clipboard History tool can be a real life saver when it's time comes.<br>
This tool stores record of all the clipboard items transfered to Clipjump in the last "x" days. The "x" days can be selected a/c your preference from
 the settings editor.<br><br>
To open the Clipboard History tool , you can also use the <b>keyboard shortcut</b> <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> other than the Tray Menu shortcut.<br>
To load full-size clip from the list provided by History tool, double-click on the item.<br>
To delete a history item , Right-click on it and select "<b>Delete</b>".<br><br>

<strong class=mild>Tip</strong> - To view only Clipboard images in the History list, you can filter the listing something like
<code CLASS=syntax>[IMAGE]</code><br><br><br>

<h4><a name=partial>Partial Searching</a></h4>
When the checkbox 'Partial' is checked , the History Tool follows a partial checking pattern. Now you will be able to filter the Histroy List with <code>Space</code> delimited terms and only those clips will be shown which have all those space delimited terms in them. 
<br><br><br>

<h4><a name=preview>The Preview Window</a></h4>
The History Preview Window previews the requested history clip. It supports preview of all types of clips from text to images. When previewing text , you have the option 
to search for terms (Ctrl+F) and the searching algorithm inhibits the 'Partial Searching' setting from the History Tool. <br>
When previewing images , you can enlarge the image by resizing the preview windows . Maximize it to see the maximum possible size of the image preview.
<br><br><br>

<h4><a name=ipaste>Insta-Paste</a></h4>
Press Space or Middle Mouse Button after choosing your desired Clipboard item(s) in the history Gui to paste it directly to the underlying window.<br>
This method necessarily closes the History GUI. When selecting multiple items and then Insta-pasti'ng, the listing order is the order in which the clips are pasted. <br>
<strong class=mild>TIP</strong> - To force Insta-Paste to write to Clipboard (Clipjump) when it is used, change instapaste_write_clipboard to 1 in the [Advanced] section of Settings.ini file.
<br><br><br>

<h4><a name=incog>Incognito Mode</a></h4>
When in Incognito mode, the Clipboard history will not be captured by Clipjump and the Clipjump icon in the System tray will fade (become greyyish).<BR>
This feature can be very useful for maintaining Privacy.<br>
To ever enable Incognito mode, use the Tray menu.<br><br><br>

<h4><a name=more>More Features</a></h4>
Right Click on an item in the Clipboard History list to view more options like Export Clip, Edit Clip and Delete Clip(s).
<br><br><br>

<h4><a name=editclip>Edit Clip</a></h4> - With the Edit Clip option option, you can edit any clip with the 
<a href=basic_help.html#default_editor>default Editor</a> or the default Image Editor. 
When the editor window shows up, you can make any changes and <b>save (Ctrl+S) the file</b>. The clip will be reloaded in the History List once you have closed the editor.<br>
Note that this option works for images too.
<br><br><br>

<a name=dis_his><h4>Disabling the History tool</h4></a> - Change the <code>Number of days to keep items in History</code> setting to 0 to permanently 
disable History tool. This will make Clipjump automatically start with the <b>Incognito Mode</b> ON as a symbol to show that History is not captured. <br>
Please note that disabling the history tool in the way as said above will not delete old history items unlike to the fact that if you change the <code>Number of days to keep items in History</code> from 50 to 2, the history older than 2 days will be deleted by Clipjump.
<br><br><br>

<a name=his_short><h4>Changing History Tool shortcut</h4></a> - The History tool shortcut (Win + C) can be changed or disabled via the Clipjump 
Settings (Setting.ini) file. Just open the file and search for the key <code>history_K</code> in section <code>[Advanced]</code>. <br>
By default, you will see the <i>history_K</i> key with the value <code>Win + C</code>. Empty this value to disable shortcut for History Tool or change this value to a 
preferred shortcut to change the History tool shortcut.<br>
Example values of <i>history_K</i> are -
<pre>Shift+C
Win+Alt+H

Ctrl+Home
F9</pre>
The 3rd value is kept blank to demonstrate the NULL value which disables the History Tool shortcut.
