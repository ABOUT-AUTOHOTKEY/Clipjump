	<dt>Error on Program startup</dt>
	<dd>Majority of these errors happen because of syntax errors in a plugin. The Error message box contains all information about the error the plugin and where it is 
		faulty in this case. In the image shown below, the first arrow shows the file (the plugin file) with the error and the second arrow shows the line number where 
		it is faulty.<br>

		To get rid of the problem, simply remove that plugin from the plugins folder and then try contacting its developer. A screenshot of the error box will help.</dd>

	<dt>I see Japanese / Chinese characters as boxes ?</dt>
	<dd>This is a uncommon <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/1eea3d70-c29a-4a80-9dd7-87ec131f160a/chinese-characters-showing-as-blocks-on-windows-7?forum=w7itproappcompat">Windows Issue</a>
	 and has nothing to do with Clipjump. To fix it , create a text-file named as ÁÅ´ or some other chinese on the Desktop and logoff and on. You should be back to normal.

	<dt>Clipboard change is not captured and Settings are not saved</dt>
	<dd>Clipjump will need to have 'write access' to the folder it is placed in. So if you are placing Clipjump in C:\ drive like <code>Program Files/Clipjump</code> you 
		might need to <b>run Clipjump as administrator</b> to have disk rights. If you don't want to run it with administrator previlidges, place it in other local drive 
		like 'D:\' or another folder like 'My Documents' where it will have rights to "atleast" write to its own folder.</dd>

	<br><br><br> 

	<dt>My plugins don't show in the Plugin Manager</dt>
	<dd>If you have placed a plugin file or edited one while Clipjump was running, it will not be loaded into the program. You will have to restart Clipjump (preferrably 
		from the System Tray Menu) to load it.</dd>

	<dt>I see an error not listed on this page</dt>
	<dd><a href="../contact.html">Contact the author</a> and that will be fixed in the next version. :-)</dd>
